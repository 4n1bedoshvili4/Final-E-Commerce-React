# Final E-Commerce React Project

This project is a React-based e-commerce web application for my final exam in REACT Lecture.

The initial idea and base concept for this project originated from a project
I created during my **Women in AI course approximately two years ago**. (Original project was not MY idea also. I found the template on a website and copied it with some added functionality)
That original project served as inspiration and starting point,
and this version has been **extended, refactored, and improved** to meet the current requirements.

This is my Original project repository:  
https://github.com/4n1bedoshvili/Final-E-Commerce

but i will upload this new version on my new github account.
